# Code Challenge: Movie Search

[![](https://github.com/ThomasBurleson/movie-search-rsm-react/assets/210413/4970a267-7c97-4bd0-abbb-69dcada13ba4)](https://github.com/ThomasBurleson/movie-search-rsm-react/assets/210413/4970a267-7c97-4bd0-abbb-69dcada13ba4)

This ^ is an web application with simple master-detail view UX. But it currently does not work!

To fix and improve the **Movie Search** web application, you will need to first configure your local development environment with source, packages, and tools.

<br/>
<br/>


## Developer Setup

- Fork the [FE Code Challenge - Starter](https://github.com/degreed/FE-Coding-Challenges-Starter) repository
- Clone your Fork repository locally
- Checkout a feature branch called `solution`
- Go to the Angular or React application source using the Terminal:
  - `cd ./FE/angular`
  - `cd ./FE/react`
- run `npm i` to install all required packages
- run `ng serve` to attempt to build and run the application locally.

If you want to upgrade the packages and libraries, please do so. Just be prepared to explain why you updated each library. ;-)

<br/>
<br/>

## Fix MovieSearch (required)

When initially compiling or serving the application, you will most likely see **compile**, **runtime**, and/or **UI errors**.

> You may even be shown an empty browser page!

Now, you will need to:

- fix the application to compile and run properly.
- fix all jest tests and lint errors.
- ensure the web app displays the UX illustrated above.

### Your Tasks:

Here are tasks and considerations that will help you understand the scope of the minimum **required** fixes:

- Resolve CSS and layout bugs to deliver the expected UX.
- Resolve compile-time and run-time bugs.
- Consider code readability and organization important
- Organize code per Angular best practices and SOLID principles
- Demonstrate competence with RxJS
- Address any a11y issues
- Provide working, valid Jest tests

Don't forget that you can also add (2) Refactors and (3) Bonus Extras to your code challenge!

### When Finished:

When you are finished with the Code Challenge and wish to submit your results for review:

1. Push your feature branch (with clean commits) to your Github repository 
2. Prepare a **Pull-Request** (PR) on *your* repo (not Degreed's)
3. Add your Degreed Developers as "requested reviewers".
4. The Degreed developers will start a Code Review on your PR: comments, suggestions, et
5. A **Zoom meeting** may be requested to discuss your changes. You should expect _deep_ questions regarding why, impacts, and tradeoffs.
7. Be prepared for possible requests to make changes and **update the PR**.

The interviewers will evaluate both your submission and your participation in the Code Review process. 
Both your solution and your Code Review participation will be used to determine your success within the challenge.
