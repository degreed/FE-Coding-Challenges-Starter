# Getting Started

Here is what your web application UX looks like:

This ^ is an web application with simple master-detail view UX. But it currently does not work!

To fix the **Movie Search** web application, you will need to first configure your local development environment with source, packages, and tools.

## Developer Setup

- Fork the [FE Code Challenge - Starter](https://github.dev/degreed/fe-coding-challenge) repository
  - this source will be your `upstream` repository.This repository is where you will also **submit** your Pull Request
  - your cloud _fork_ will be your `origin` repository where you will manage your feature branch work
- Clone the `origin` repository locally
- Checkout a feature branch called `solution`
- Go to the Angular or React application source using the Terminal:
  - `cd ./FE/angular`
  - `cd ./FE/react`
- run `npm i` to install all required packages
- run `ng serve` to attempt to build and run the application locally.

If you want to upgrade the packages and libraries, please do so. Just be prepared to explain why you updated each library. ;-)

## Fix MovieSearch

When initially compiling or serving the application, you will most likely see **compile**, **runtime**, and/or **UI errors**.

> You may even be shown an empty browser page!

Now, you will need to:

- fix the application to compile and run properly.
- fix all jest tests and lint errors.
- ensure the web app displays the UX illustrated above.

### Your Tasks:

Here are tasks and considerations that will help you understand the scope of the minimum **required** fixes:

- Resolve CSS and layout bugs to deliver the expected UX.
- Resolve compile-time and run-time bugs.
- Consider code readability and organization important
- Organize code per Angular best practices and SOLID principles
- Demonstrate competence with RxJS
- Address any a11y issues
- Provide working, valid Jest tests

### When Finished:

When you are finished with the Code Challenge and wish to submit your results for review:

1. Prepare a **Pull-Request** (PR) on the 'upstream' repository.
2. A FE Engineer will start a Code Review for your PR.
3. A **Zoom meeting** may be requested to discuss your changes. You should expect _deep_ questions regarding why, impacts, and tradeoffs.
4. Be prepared for possible requests to make changes and **update the PR**.

The interviewers will evaluate both your submission and your participation in the Code Review process. Both parts will be used to determine your success within the challenge.
