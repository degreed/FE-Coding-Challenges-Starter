## The Code Challenge

Your challenges are:

- Fix and repair the web application code to serve a running application.
- Provide optional refactors to demonstrate your skills and insight
- Implement bonus features to demonstrate advance knowledge and skills

> Please note that only the 'fix and repair' aspect is REQUIRED for this challenge.

### Extras

Candidates can work on one or all aspects (fixes, refactors, and bonuses).

Your solutions for each aspect will be evaluated based on internal Degreed criteria points. The candidate with the most points will be the winner of the challenge.

### The Challenge Process

1. You will be asked to work on solution(s) for our **MovieSearch** application... and prepare a Pull-Request (PR).
   - You must write the solutions yourself **WITHOUT** help or copying code from another source.
   - One or more interviewers will perform a code review of your PR.
2. A zoom meeting may be requested to discuss your changes.
   - You should expect deep questions **why**, **impacts**, and **tradeoffs**.
3. Finally, you _may_ be requested to make changes and update the PR.
4. The interviewers will evaluate your submission and your participation in the Code Review process. Both parts will be used to determine your success within the challenge.

Don't worry, we don't expect perfect code!

We only hope to see results equivalent to the role you are applying for.

- If you are applying for **entry level** engineer, you will only be asked entry-level questions and rated for entry-level solutions.
- If you are applying for **senior** levels, our expectations are for senior _solutions_ and senior _knowledge_.

---

We want to assess your **skills**, **knowledge**, and **creativity**... as well as your ability to _communicate_ and _collaborate_.

This challenge is **both** a technical and non-technical test.
