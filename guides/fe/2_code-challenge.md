# The Code Challenge

The **Senior FE Engineer** code challenge has three aspects:

1. **Bug Hunt** (required)
2. **Refactors** (optional)
3. **Enhancements** (optional)

Please notes that all three (3) aspects will be graded assess the winner of a code challenge.

---

## 1) “Bug Hunt” (required)

This is the required aspect of the code challenge.

You will need to:

- fix the application to compile and run properly.
- fix all jest tests and lint errors.
- ensure the web app displays the UX illustrated in the images below:

#### Your Tasks:

Here are tasks and considerations that will help you understand the scope of the minimum **required** fixes:

- Resolve CSS and layout bugs to deliver the expected UX.
- Resolve compile-time and run-time bugs.
- Consider code readability and organization important
- Organize code per Angular best practices and SOLID principles
- Demonstrate competence with RxJS
- Address any a11y issues
- Demonstrate working Jest tests and scope

## 2) Refactors (Optional)

Here are some suggestions if you want to improve the application solution beyond the minimum fixes:

- Avoid - if possible - manual RxJS subscriptions.
- Create a Movies [feature module](https://medium.com/coding-in-depth/angular-why-and-when-to-create-a-feature-component-and-feature-module-622351b5d136)
- Create a Movies Data-access library (folder)
- Use container/presenter patterns
- Flatten component hierarchy as appropriate

Please be prepared to explain and discuss these refactors. You should be aware of the benefits, risks, and tradeoffs.

---

## 3) Bonus Efforts (Optional)

Finally, here are some suggestions if you want to impress the Degreed team(s) with elite skills.

- Better state management
- Use facades/view models
- Use lazy libraries + feature modules
- Use tailwind instead of SCSS

> Please be prepared to explain and discuss these refactors. You should be aware of the benefits, risks, and tradeoffs.

It is important to emphasize that these considerations, refactors, patterns, and practices are all used within our production code at Degreed.
